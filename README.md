# Tinker

The easiest and fastest way to start new web projects with [invoker-next](https://github.com/meridianid/invoker-next), [invoker-gatsby](https://github.com/meridianid/invoker-gatsby), and soon invoker-crapp.

## Requirements

To use this CLI tools properly, you need to have these installed on your machine

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. `npm` -- you already have this if you install Node.js, or if you like me, you can use `yarn`. Go to [here to install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).
3. `gatsby-cli` to scaffold gatsby project. Run `npm install -g gatsby-cli` or `yarn global add gatsby-cli` on your terminal to install it.

### Optional

1. [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/) for quick deployment. Run `npm install -g netlify-cli` or `yarn global add netlify-cli` on your terminal to install it.
2. Or you can use [Now.sh](https://now.sh)

## Installation

To install it on your machine, just run this command on your terminal

```shell
npm install -g mid-tinker-cli
```

or if you are using yarn

```shell
yarn global add mid-tinker-cli
```

## Usage

Tinker will help you scaffold 2 kind of starter which are Next.js and Gatsby.js

### create-react-app (crapp)

We are going to publish the starter based the awesome on create-react-app soon!
